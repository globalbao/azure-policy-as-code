# Bicep\Learn

Contains example code and video walkthrough structured into 3x levels so that beginners could start with a small proof of concept deployment (e.g. Level1) and then scale up in complexity and advanced logic (Level3) as comfort levels increase with Bicep and Azure Policy

> More experienced users can jump straight to Level3 and learn/adopt a Policy as Code workflow with Bicep straight away

Links to skip to specific content levels in the recorded YouTube session are included in each folder's README
